Script for getting new nflscrapR data. Be sure to read all the comments and change numbers as needed.

Credit to [@LeeSharpeNFL](https://twitter.com/LeeSharpeNFL) and [@benbbaldwin](https://twitter.com/benbbaldwin) who's code I used in part of this script for getting new data and cleaning it. 

The data folder contains both cleaned and uncleaned CSVs. The cleaned is the result of the script in this repo, the raw is before any cleaning within the script.
